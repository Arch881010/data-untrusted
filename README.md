# data-website-untrusted

A website of Untrusted's Skills and Class data. Visit: [https://playuntrusted.com](https://playuntrusted.com) for the game.
I am not the owner of untrusted nor accociated with untrusted. I am only a player that decided to make this somewhat cruddy website for myself and others out there to have another way to access this data.
You can access the data through the API listed on my website, or just by visiting here: [https://www.playuntrusted.com/public-api/](https://www.playuntrusted.com/public-api/)!
You could also use this data by using the Discord bot in Untrusted's Discord ([http://discord.playuntrusted.com/](http://discord.playuntrusted.com/)) or using the source code of the bot by following the read me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastagoon/untrusted-discord).
